# Atom CodeSearch

Super-fast search for code using different search engines:

- ripgrep (`rg`)
- The Silver Searcher (`ag`)
- The Platinum Searcher (`pt`)
- Google CodeSearch (`csearch`)

You will find this package useful if searching across your code takes a lot of time. With CodeSearch, it's a couple of seconds.
